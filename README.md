# Password Generator Starter Code

This simple JavaScript application generates a random password based on user preferences for length and character types. It allows users to include their preference of certain uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.

## Usage

When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, the application will prompt the user with pop up boxes for the desired password length (between 8 and 128 characters) and the types of characters to include. The generated password is displayed in the designated text area. To keep doing it over and over again, hit refresh in the brower

### Features

- Users can select the password length within the range of 8 to 128 characters.
- Users can include the following types of characters in the password:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Special characters (!, @, #, $, %, etc.)
  - Numbers (0-9)

### How it Works

The application uses JavaScript to handle user input and generate random passwords based on the selected criteria. It utilizes event listeners and prompts to interact with the user and update the password accordingly.

Enjoy!
